Do NOT put placeholder text within a form field, it makes it difficult for
people to remember what they were typing in and it makes it hard to fix errors.
When you type into a form field with placeholder text the text disappears.
Instead have a label above the form field.

To prevent user errors: be flexible. To fix slips: guide the user, inlcude
helpful constraints ex; picking flight dates, the return can't be before the
departure.
suggestions: in search boxes give the best guesses in case of typos.
good defaults: precision when doing something repetitive ex: reminder apps.
forgiving formatting: scannable and easy to spot mistakes. example: phone #
spacing.
