i. the difference between absolute and relative URLS is that absolute is
the entire web address of the page you're linking, and relative is just
/page; it relies on your browser to understand. A reason why relative might
be better is that it is faster and easier to code.

ii. You're able to 'scrape' the entire project and put it in a new domain.
It also prevents duplicates from forming.

iii. The four different sites are about how your URL is duplicated four times
when you are using relative. This does not happen when you use abosulte URLs.

iv. Crawl budget is important and useful because Google thinks your website is,
and that it includes how much it's updated.
