In chapter 4, I found the scan your body and the journaling interesting.
In my Psych class last year we sat in corpse pose for an hour and the teacher
read off what should we be focusing on, just like scanning your body. For
example he would say, "focus all your energy on you toes". For the journaling,
I actually write in a journal every day. I really like it because it does
get all my anger out on a subject. This week, I will try more on focusing
on the topics he said to focus on while writing.
